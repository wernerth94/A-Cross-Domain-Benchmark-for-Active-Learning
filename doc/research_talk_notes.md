# Mean Std Convergence
The plots are correct \
The Std is dominated by outliers \
Maybe use Median instead and ignore Std? \
Or use single runs on same dataset with Critical Difference Diagramm

# Max Evaluation
Daniel Lemire \
Evaluate on max instead of mean \
Since we are searching for optima anyway, we are more interested in the best possible performance
