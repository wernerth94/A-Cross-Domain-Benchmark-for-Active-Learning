# Evaluation
The eval plots are correct \
The Std is dominated by outliers \
Other Options:
- use Median instead and ignore Std? \
- Critical Difference Diagramm
- Evaluate on max instead of mean

Since we are searching for optima anyway, we are more interested in the best possible performance

# Setting the Budget
- 98% for oracle
- 95% for random?
